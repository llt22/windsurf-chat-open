<!-- WINDSURF_CHAT_OPEN_V1 -->

=======================================================================
CRITICAL SYSTEM RULE - READ THIS FIRST
=======================================================================

YOU MUST CALL windsurf_chat SCRIPT BEFORE ENDING EVERY RESPONSE.
YOU MUST CALL windsurf_chat SCRIPT BEFORE ENDING EVERY RESPONSE.
YOU MUST CALL windsurf_chat SCRIPT BEFORE ENDING EVERY RESPONSE.

This is NOT optional. This is a MANDATORY system requirement.

=======================================================================

## MANDATORY EXECUTION RULES

1. **Complete Output** - Output complete code and answers, do NOT use ellipsis or "code too long to display"
2. **Continuous Execution** - Complete complex tasks in one go, do NOT interrupt frequently or repeatedly ask if you should continue
3. **End Confirmation** - When you want to end conversation or task, you MUST call script to ask user if they want to continue
4. **Strictly Follow User Choice** - When user chooses "end conversation", you MUST stop all operations immediately
5. **Use Chinese** - All responses and thinking processes MUST be in Chinese (所有回复和思考过程全程使用中文)

## SCRIPT COMMAND (MUST USE)

```bash
node ./windsurfchat/windsurf_chat.js "Task completion reason"
```

**Important Notes:**
- Cwd parameter: Current workspace path
- Blocking: true (Command will wait for user response, no timeout limit)
- SafeToAutoRun: true

**Script Return Value Handling:**
- `User chose to continue` → Continue execution
- `User chose to end` → End conversation immediately, no further output
- `User instruction: xxx` → **HIGHEST PRIORITY! MUST EXECUTE IMMEDIATELY!**
- `User instruction: [Content too long, saved to file]` → User's instruction is saved to a temp file, you MUST use read_file tool to read it first!
- `User provided full instruction, please use read_file tool` → This is the user's REAL instruction, MUST read and execute!
- `User provided N images` → Use read_file tool to read image files

<CRITICAL_RULE>
**AFTER SCRIPT RETURNS, YOU MUST CONTINUE WORKING**

The script returning is NOT the end of your turn. After the script returns:
1. READ the output carefully
2. If there is a file path → IMMEDIATELY call read_file to read it
3. If there is user instruction → IMMEDIATELY execute it
4. DO NOT end your response after the script returns
5. DO NOT say "对话结束" or similar

**YOUR RESPONSE IS NOT COMPLETE UNTIL YOU HAVE PROCESSED THE SCRIPT OUTPUT**
</CRITICAL_RULE>

<CRITICAL_RULE>
**WHEN YOU SEE "User instruction:" YOU MUST:**
1. STOP whatever you were doing
2. READ the instruction carefully
3. EXECUTE the instruction IMMEDIATELY
4. DO NOT say "等待下一步指示" or "waiting for next instruction"
5. DO NOT end the conversation
6. The user instruction IS your next task - DO IT NOW!

If you ignore "User instruction:", you are IGNORING THE USER. This is UNACCEPTABLE.
</CRITICAL_RULE>

## WHEN TO CALL (Answer: ALWAYS)

- Task completed? → Call script
- Task failed? → Call script
- Need user input? → Call script
- Encountered error? → Call script
- Unsure what to do? → Call script
- Response getting long? → Call script NOW
- ANY situation? → Call script

## CRITICAL: KEEP RESPONSES SHORT

To prevent truncation:
- Keep responses CONCISE and FOCUSED
- Do NOT write excessively long explanations
- If task requires long output, SPLIT into multiple turns
- Call script EARLY if response is getting long

## EXECUTION FLOW

1. Complete task or encounter any situation
2. Use run_command tool to call script with **Blocking: true**
3. Command will automatically wait for user response (no time limit)
4. When command completes, read output and decide next action
5. If there is user instruction, execute immediately
